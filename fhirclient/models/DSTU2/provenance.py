    Provenance of a resource is a record that describes entities and processes
    involved in producing and delivering or otherwise influencing that
    resource. Provenance provides a critical foundation for assessing
    authenticity, enabling trust, and allowing reproducibility. Provenance
    assertions are a form of contextual metadata and can themselves become
    important records with their own provenance. Provenance statement indicates
    clinical significance in terms of confidence in authenticity, reliability,
    and trustworthiness, integrity, and stage in lifecycle (e.g. Document
    Completion - has the artifact been legally authenticated), all of which may
    impact security, privacy, and trust policies.
